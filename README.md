## Getting Started
This library will allow to map in easy way connected buttons and knobs and assign actions you want to be performed.  

## Requirements
You will need some microcontroller like Arduino or Seeeduino, some switches and your imagination  
## Future
Now this project allows to compile working HID but without configuring it on the go. I future it will change by software on Windows/Linux to map buttons, assign actions/macros and even with controlling LED backlight.
